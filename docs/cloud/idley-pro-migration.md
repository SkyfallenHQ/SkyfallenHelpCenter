# Activating Your Skyfallen Cloud Account Post-Migration from Idley Pro.

All Idley Pro users have been moved to Skyfallen Cloud for Gaming along with all their data. This document outlines the process for getting access back to your servers.

## Step 1: Locate the recovery email
We have sent every moved account a recovery email in the form of a reset password link. Try locating that email in your inbox.

### Step 1.1: If you can't find it or the link doesn't work.
If you are unable to locate it, it's not a problem. Visit Skyfallen ID password reset page [here](https://id.skyfallen.org/auth/?action=lostpassword).
### Step 1.2: Enter your email and submit.
Type your email related to the Idley Pro purchases you made. This is the email that was used to send your invoices. Click **Get new password** afterwards.

You should now receive an updated version of the email.
## Step 2: Set a new password
Visit the link in your email and type a password that you find secure and click **Save Password**.
